# wormhole

This generates donut-shaped wormholes on the GPU! I'm not sure
the geometry is right though - the visual discontinuities are suspicious.

You can try it yourself by cloning the repo and running `cargo run` in the
repo directory. Clicking on the window captures the cursor for camera control,
clicking again releases the cursor. `w,a,s,d,q,e` keys (as laid out on
a standard QWERTY keyboard) also allow controlling the camera.

It may be dangerous to the health of your system to come into contact
with a wormhole - this has crashed multiple machines. Fly safe!
